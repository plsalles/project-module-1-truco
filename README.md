# Truco Game

This is a reprodution of the card game Truco. The game is focused more on the implementation of the logic of all rules and features the truco game has. 

## Acknowledgments

First of all I would like to say THANKS to my teacher and all TAs's for all the help they have given during the project. 

## Getting Started

There's no prerequisites to play the game, just open the page and enjoy. As both players cards are shown in the same browser, playing with two users should not be interesting as one player would know the cards of the other player, that's why the main gola of this prohject was to implement all rules of the game and in a future possible improve the player usability implementing multi session players.



## Prerequisites

No hardware prerequisites needed. Just run the game and have fun!

## Game rules

This game follows the Truco rules. As there are some variations of truco game around the world, I rules applied here follows the rule of Truco played in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

## Game and Coding Improvements

A lot of changes and improvements were done, but due to the limited time to work on it and short schedule, it is pending a implementation of multi session player.

## Contributing

Please feel free to fork/clone this repo to look deeper into this game and contribute with some of the above improvements if you like. I plan to work on it in the future as well :-)
